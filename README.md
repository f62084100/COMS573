1. (20 points) Consider the toy data set {([0, 0], −1),([2, 2], −1),([2, 0], +1)}. Set up the dual problem for the toy data set. Then, solve the dual problem and compute α
∗, the optimal Lagrange
multipliers. (Note that there will be three weights w = [w0, w1, w2] by considering the bias.)
2. (15 points) In a separable case, when a multiplier αi > 0, its corresponding data point (xi, yi) is on
the boundary of the optimal separating hyperplane with yi(wTxi) = 1.Show that the inverse is not True. Namely, it is possible that αi = 0 and (xi, yi) is on the boundary
satisfying yi(wTxi) = 1.
[Hint: Consider a toy data set with two positive examples at ([0,0], +1) and ([1, 0], +1), and
one negative example at ([0, 1], -1).] (Note that there will be three weights w = [w0, w1, w2] by
considering the bias.)
